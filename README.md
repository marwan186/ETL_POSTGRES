# ETL Project using Python and PostgreSQL

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that uses Python and PostgreSQL to automate the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline consists of several steps, including connecting to data sources, cleaning and transforming data, and creating tables in the PostgreSQL database to store the transformed data.
